            <p> Hatsu represents the individual's unique expression of Nen, reflecting their personality, desires, and
                abilities. Hatsu allows users to shape and manipulate their aura into specialized techniques or
                abilities tailored to their preferences and strengths. Hatsu requires a deep understanding of one's inner self and extensive training to
                develop and refine. Through Hatsu,
                characters in "Hunter x Hunter" explore their potential, uncovering new abilities and strategies to
                overcome challenges and adversaries in their journey.</p>
