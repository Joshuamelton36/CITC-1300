            <h2> What to expect? </h2>
            <p> This will provide a short list of Hatsu users so you can get the feel for hunter hunter's power system,
                be warned, spoilers lie ahead. Discovering what somone's nen ability can be the most fun part. </p>

            <h2> Gon's Rock-Paper-Scissors</h2>
            <img src="images/download (2).jpg" alt="gon">
            <p> Gon almost has three techniques in one, he combines enhancer, emitter, and Transmutation into his hatsu ability.</p>\
                <p> First comes rock: This ability is your basic hit harder, Gon stances up and concentrates most of his energy into his fist, unleashing a leathal amount of nen within it.</p>
                <p> Second comes paper: This is his transmutation ability, allowing him to turn nen into a sharp sword, letting him easily mince through enemies.</p>
                <p> Third comes rock: This is his emitter ability, he essentially fires a blast out of his hand for range based attacks.</p>

            <h2> Killua's Godspeed + thunderbolt</h2>
            <img src="images/download (3).jpg" alt="killua">
                <p> Killua uses his expertise with electricity to create it out of his nen, using it for ranged attacks and close ranged shocking grasps alike. His most powerful use of this technique is slipping into Enhancement though, where he boosts his speed to a ridculous level. Even one of the royal chimera ant gaurds, one of the strongest nen users, couldn't touch him in this form. </p>
            <h2> Hisoka's Bungee gum</h2>

            <img src="images/rubberGum.gif" alt="hisoka">
                <p> Has the properties of rubber and gum!</p>

            <h2> Kurapika's chains</h2>
            <img src="images/chainjail.jpg" alt="kura">
                <p> Kurapika's chains are interesting because they use a unique side of Nen, binding vows.By sacraficing something they get a big boon to their strength. In Kurapika's case this means he can only use his best chain attacks on the phantom troupe. Even still, outside of them he can conjure chains for devastating ranged attacks. </p>
                <p> This technique becomes an entirely different beast when he's fighting a phantom troupe member however, as he can use and ability called 'chain jail'. This allows him to trap a member in this 'chain jail' and render them in a state of complete zetsu, meaning they cannot use any nen. With how strong Kurapika's chains are, it's utterly impossible to break free when they bind you.</p>
