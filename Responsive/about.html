                <h2> Beef tips brown gravy with broccoli </h2>
                <img src="images/beefbrown.jpg" alt="5 Ingredient Chili">
                <hr>
                <p> While not as popular as the others, it's one of my favorite meals from my childhood. Beef tips, or beef scraps, are cheap and generally used for stews and the like. Being a cheap cut does have disadvantages, though, as it can be tough if not prepared properly. But paired with an excellent gravy, which you can just easily buy mix for, can make a great centerpiece to a meal. Broccoli and normally potatoes serve as great sides.</p>

                <p> Beef Tips (1 pound): Price: $8.00 </p>
                <p> Broccoli (1 head, chopped) Price: $2.50 </p>
